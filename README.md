# Learning group form

Generated with BLACKBOX AI Builder

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
# or
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### Supabase Setup (Required for cross-device sync)

This application uses Supabase to store form entries across devices. To enable this feature:

1. Follow the detailed instructions in [SUPABASE_SETUP.md](SUPABASE_SETUP.md)
2. Create a Supabase project and table
3. Provide your Supabase credentials via `.env.local`

**Note:** Without Supabase configuration, registrations cannot be stored.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
# or
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deploy

This project is configured to deploy to GitHub Pages. Push to `main`, enable Pages in the repository settings (GitHub Actions), and visit:

```
https://<your-username>.github.io/Lerngruppe26/
```

If you rename the repository, update `basePath` and `assetPrefix` in `next.config.js`.

Note: The admin view is meant for local use only. It is disabled on GitHub Pages because client-side passwords are not secure on static sites.

If styles look missing on Vercel, ensure the deployment uses the default base path (this repo config only applies the `/Lerngruppe26` base path when building for GitHub Pages).
