# Learning group form

Generated with BLACKBOX AI Builder

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
# or
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### Firebase Setup (Required for Cross-Device Sync)

This application uses Firebase Firestore to synchronize form entries across all devices. To enable this feature:

1. Follow the detailed instructions in [FIREBASE_SETUP.md](FIREBASE_SETUP.md)
2. Create a Firebase project and enable Firestore
3. Provide your Firebase credentials via `.env.local` (recommended)
4. Configure Firestore security rules as described in the setup guide

**Note:** Without Firebase configuration, the app will still work but entries will only be stored locally on each device.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
# or
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deploy

This project is configured to deploy to GitHub Pages. Push to `main`, enable Pages in the repository settings (GitHub Actions), and visit:

```
https://<your-username>.github.io/Lerngruppe26/
```

If you rename the repository, update `basePath` and `assetPrefix` in `next.config.js`.

Note: The admin view is meant for local use only. It is disabled on GitHub Pages because client-side passwords are not secure on static sites.

If styles look missing on Vercel, ensure the deployment uses the default base path (this repo config only applies the `/Lerngruppe26` base path when building for GitHub Pages).
