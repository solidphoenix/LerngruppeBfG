# Learning group form

Generated with BLACKBOX AI Builder

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
# or
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### Supabase Setup (Required for cross-device sync)

This application uses Supabase to store form entries across devices. To enable this feature:

1. Follow the detailed instructions in [SUPABASE_SETUP.md](SUPABASE_SETUP.md)
2. Create a Supabase project and table
3. Provide your Supabase credentials via `.env.local`

**Note:** Without Supabase configuration, registrations cannot be stored.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
# or
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### KI-Setup (ChatGPT und/oder Claude)

This application supports both AI providers. You can configure one or both — when both are configured, you can switch between them in the KI-Assistent UI.

#### OpenAI (ChatGPT)

1. Go to [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/signup) and create an account
2. Open [API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) in the settings
3. Click **"Create new secret key"** and copy it (starts with `sk-`)
4. Add credit under [Billing](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview) (from $5 USD)

#### Anthropic (Claude)

1. Go to [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/) and create an account
2. Navigate to [Settings → API Keys](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys)
3. Click **"Create Key"** and copy it (starts with `sk-ant-`)
4. Add credit under [Settings → Billing](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/billing) (from $5 USD)

#### Configure in `.env.local`:

```env
# Add one or both:
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-api-key-here
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini

ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-api-key-here
ANTHROPIC_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-20250514
```

> **Note:** A ChatGPT Plus or Claude Pro subscription ($20/month) is **not** the same as API credit. The API requires separate prepaid credit.

## Deploy

This project is configured to deploy to GitHub Pages. Push to `main`, enable Pages in the repository settings (GitHub Actions), and visit:

```
https://<your-username>.github.io/Lerngruppe26/
```

If you rename the repository, update `basePath` and `assetPrefix` in `next.config.js`.

Note: The admin view is meant for local use only. It is disabled on GitHub Pages because client-side passwords are not secure on static sites.

If styles look missing on Vercel, ensure the deployment uses the default base path (this repo config only applies the `/Lerngruppe26` base path when building for GitHub Pages).
